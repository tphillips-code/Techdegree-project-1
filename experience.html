        <p>I've had some experience in HTML and CSS, but I never felt comfotable with either of them.</p>
        <p>Now I'm studying with Treehouse to really master those skills and so far it's going great!</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">Other Work</h2>
        <p>After I graduated high school, I took my first job at a manufacturing plant. I eventually worked at 3 more manufacturing plants before finding my current job, which I've been at for the last 5 years.</p>
        <p>I also joined the Army National Guard while in high school, however after 6 great years I ended my contract in 2018.</p>
